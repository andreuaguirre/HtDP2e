; Exercise 128. Copy the following tests into DrRacketâ€™s definitions area:

(check-member-of "green" "red" "yellow" "grey")
; "green" is not in "red" "yellow" "grey"

(check-within (make-posn #i1.0 #i1.1)

(check-range #i0.9 #i0.6 #i0.8)
; 0.9 not in range of [0.6 0.8]

(check-random (make-posn (random 3) (random 9))
              (make-posn (random 9) (random 3)))
; random posn-x failed

(check-satisfied 4 odd?)
; 4 is not odd


; Validate that all of them fail and explain why.
