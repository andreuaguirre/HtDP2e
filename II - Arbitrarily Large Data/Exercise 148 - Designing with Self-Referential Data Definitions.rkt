; Exercise 148. Compare the function definitions from this section
; (sum, how-many, all-true, one-true) with the corresponding function definitions
; from the preceding sections. Is it better to work with data definitions that
; accommodate empty lists as opposed to definitions for non-empty lists? Why? Why not?

;; It's better working with non-empty lists if you want to compare two things of the list.
