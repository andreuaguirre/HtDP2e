; Exercise 178. Explain why the template for editor-kh deals
; with "\t" and "\r" before it checks for strings of length 1.

;; Because Racket reads the cond clauses in order and
;; "\t", "\r" and so, are 1Strings themselves.
;; If you write the 1string clause before the "\t",
;; the latter is never gonna happen.
